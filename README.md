# Rock ~ Paper ~ Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors, the simple decision making game that heralds back to the school yard and continues to be a simple decision making tool which many people everywhere have carried forward int o their adult lives.  Using "Rock Paper Scissors" to make decisions that allowed for degrees of winning and losing, all based on true sporting random chance.

The game is simple to learn and easy to imitate.  The purpose of this site is to allow a graphical interface from which young players can easily pick up and understand the rules, through engaing with the computer which will never cheat.

The game it's self will run for a cycle of 5 games, declaring the winner for each and then declaring the overall winner, after which the scores are reset to 0, once more.

## Features left to implement:
I plan to add options of "continue to play" and the addition of "Lizard and Spock", which is gaining online, popularity.

The games of 3 choices and 5 choices will be kept seperate in initial choice, so the user can choose which to play upon the site loading.

I also would like to add the five button gamea of "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" as a an "offer" to the player after they have played the three button choice game and if they have won, 3 games on the trott.
